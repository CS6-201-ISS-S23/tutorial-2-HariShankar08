            1. Create a HTML page that displays the exact same output. Make sure you stick to the standards,
            for example &lt;br/&gt; tag should be closed. Also check when your tags are paired, for example
            there should be one &lt;p&gt; tag for every &lt;p&gt; tag
        </p>

        <b><p>
            2. This note in bold.
        </p></b>

        <p align="center">
            3. This is the first centred paragraph.
        </p>    

        <p align="left">
            4. This is the second paragraph. It appears on the left.
        </p>

        <p align="right">
            5. This is the third paragraph. It appears on the right.
        </p>

        <h3>6. This is a level 3 heading.</h3>


        <h5 align="right">7. This is a level 5 heading.</h3>

        <p>8. Below is a horizontal line with 50% width with respect to browser width.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>9. Below is a horizontal line which is 100 pixels wide.</p>
        <hr width="100px" />

        <div style="float: left; width: calc(100% - 500px);">
            <p>
                10. Now this is a little tough. The image is displayed on the right side and the text is displayed on the 
                left side. This is done using the "img" tag here, but you can use other methods to achieve the same output.
                The image has to be 500 pixels wide.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div style="float:right; width:500px;">
            <img src="heheCat.png" width="500px"/>
        </div>
